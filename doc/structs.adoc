== Structs

Golo allows the definition of simple structures using the `struct` keyword. They resemble structures
in procedural languages such as C `struct` or Pascal *records*. They are useful to store data when
the set of named entries is fixed.

=== Definition

Structures are defined at the module-level:

[source,golo]
----
module sample

struct Person = { name, age, email }

function main = |args| {
  let p1 = Person("Mr Bean", 54, "bean@gmail.com")
  println(p1: name())
  let p2 = Person(): name("John"): age(32): email("john@b-root.com")
  println(p2: age())
}
----

When declaring a structure, it also defines two factory functions: one with no argument, and one
with all arguments in their order of declaration in the `struct` statement. When not initialized,
member values are `null`.

Each member yields a *getter* and a *setter* method: given a member `a`, the getter is method `a()`
while the setter is method `a(newValue)`. It should be noted that setter methods return the
structure instance which makes it possible to chain calls as illustrated in the previous example
while building `p2`.

=== JVM existence

Each `struct` is compiled to a self-contained JVM class.

Given:

[source,golo]
----
module sample

struct Point = { x, y }
----

a class `sample.types.Point` is being generated.

It is important to note that:

1. each `struct` class is `final`,
2. each `struct` class inherits from `gololang.GoloStruct`,
3. proper definitions of `toString()`, `hashCode()` and `equals()` are being provided.

=== `toString()` behavior

The `toString()` method is being overridden to provide a meaningful description of a structure
content.

Given the following program:

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Point = { x, y }

function main = |args| {
  println(Point(1, 2))
}
----

running it prints the following console output:

----
struct Point{x=1, y=2}
----

=== Immutable structs

Structure instances are mutable by default. Golo generates a factory function with the `Immutable`
prefix to directly build immutable instances:

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Point = { x, y }

function main = |args| {

  let p = ImmutablePoint(1, 2)
  println(p)

  try {
    # Fails! (p is immutable)
    p: x(100)
  } catch (expected) {
    println(expected: getMessage())
  }
}
----

=== Custom factories

Golo generates two factories for structures. One for the initial values of each member and
a second one with no parameters:

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Point = { x, y }

function main = |args| {
  println(Point(1, 2))
  println(Point())
}
----

running it prints the following console output:

----
struct Point{x=1, y=2}
struct Point{x=null, y=null}
----

NOTE: By default the no-argument factory sets every member to `null`

The Factories generated by Golo can be overloaded by custom ones:

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Point = { x, y }

function Point = -> test.types.Point(0,0)

function main = |args| {
  println(Point(1, 2))
  println(Point())
}
----

running it prints the following console output:

----
struct Point{x=1, y=2}
struct Point{x=0, y=0}
----

NOTE: Immutable factories can be easily overloaded by returning a forzen copy.

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Point = { x, y }

function ImmutablePoint = |a,b| -> test.types.Point(a,b): frozenCopy()

function main = |args| {
  println(ImmutablePoint(1, 2): isFrozen()) # prints true
}
----


=== Copying

Instances of a structure provide copying methods:

- `copy()` returns a *shallow* copy of the structure instance, and
- `frozenCopy()` returns a read-only *shallow* copy.

Trying to invoke any setter methods on an instance obtained through `frozenCopy()` raises a
`java.lang.IllegalStateException`.

IMPORTANT: The result of calling `copy()` on a frozen instance **is a mutable** copy, not a frozen
copy.

=== `equals()` and `hashCode()` semantics

Golo structures honor the contract of Java objects regarding equality and hash codes.

By default, `equals()` and `hashCode()` are the ones of `java.lang.Object`. Indeed, structure
members can be changed, so they cannot be used to compute stable values.

Nevertheless, structure instances returned by `frozenCopy()` have stable members, and members are
being used.

Consider the following program:

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Point = { x, y }

function main = |args| {

  let p1 = Point(1, 2)
  let p2 = Point(1, 2)
  let p3 = p1: frozenCopy()
  let p4 = p1: frozenCopy()

  println("p1 == p2 " + (p1 == p2))
  println("p1 == p3 " + (p1 == p3))
  println("p3 == p4 " + (p3 == p4))

  println("#p1 " + p1: hashCode())
  println("#p2 " + p2: hashCode())
  println("#p3 " + p3: hashCode())
  println("#p4 " + p4: hashCode())
}
----

the console output is the following:

----
p1 == p2 false
p1 == p3 false
p3 == p4 true
#p1 1555845260
#p2 104739310
#p3 994
#p4 994
----

TIP: It is recommended that you use `Immutable<name of struct>(...)` or `frozenCopy()` when you can,
especially when storing values into collections.

=== Comparison semantics

Golo structures are comparable with structures of the same type, provided that their members are comparable pairwise. Two structure are compared by comparing their members lexicographically, that is pairwise in the order they are defined.

For instance, the following listing:

[source,golo]
----
module test

struct Triplet = {x, y, z}

struct Other = {x, y, z}

function main = |args| {

  let t1 = Triplet(1, 2, 3)
  let t2 = Triplet(1, 3, 2)
  let o = Other(1, 2, 4)

  println(t1 < t2)
  println(t1: values() < o: values())
  println(t1 < o)
}
----

will output:

----
true
true
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: struct Triplet{x=1, y=2, z=3} and struct Other{x=1, y=2, z=4} can't be compared
----

even if `Triplet` and `Other` have the same members.


=== Helper methods

A number of helper methods are being generated:

- `members()` returns a tuple of the member names,
- `values()` returns a tuple with the current member values,
- `isFrozen()` returns a boolean to check for frozen structure instances,
- `iterator()` provides an iterator over a structure where each element is a tuple `[member, value]`,
- `get(name)` returns the value of a member by its name,
- `set(name, value)` updates the value of a member by its name, and returns the same structure.

=== Private members

By default, all members in a struct can be accessed. It is possible to make some elements private by
prefixing them with `_`, as in:

[source,golo]
----
struct Foo = { a, _b, c }

# (...)

let foo = Foo(1, 2, 3)
----

In this case, `_b` is a private struct member. This means that `foo: _b()` and `foo: _b(666)` are
valid calls only if made from:

- a function from the declaring module, or
- an augmentation defined in the declaring module.

Any call to, say, `foo: _b()` from another module will yield a `NoSuchMethodError` exception.

Private struct members also have the following impact:

- they do not appear in `members()` and `values()` calls, and
- they are not iterated through `iterator()`-provided iterators, and
- they are being used like other members in `equals()` and `hashCode()`, and
- they do not appear in `toString()` representations.

=== Augmenting structs

Structs provide a simple data model, especially with private members for encapsulation.

Augmenting structs is encouraged, as in:

[source,golo]
----
module Plop

struct Point = { _id, x, y }

augment Plop.types.Point {

  function str = |this| -> "{id=" + this: _id() + ",x=" + this: x() + ",y=" + this: y() + "}"
}
----

When an augmentation on a struct is defined **within the same module**, then you can omit the full
type name of the struct:

[source,golo]
----
module Plop

struct Point = { _id, x, y }

augment Point {

  function str = |this| -> "{id=" + this: _id() + ",x=" + this: x() + ",y=" + this: y() + "}"
}
----

Again, it is important to note that augmentations can only access private struct members when they
originate from the same module.

[WARNING]
.Don't do this at home
====
Of course doing the following is a bad idea, with the concise augmentation taking over the
fully-qualified one:

[source,golo]
----
module Foo

struct Value = { v }

augment Foo.types.Value {

  function a = |this| -> "a"
}

# This will discard the previous augmentation...
augment Value {

  function b = |this| -> "a"
}

function check = {
  let v = Value(666)

  # Ok
  v: b()

  # Fails, the concise augmentation overrides the fully-qualifed one
  v: a()
}
----
