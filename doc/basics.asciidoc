== Basics ==

Let us start with the Golo basics.

=== Editor / IDE support ===

Editor and IDE support for Golo is available for:

- https://github.com/jponge/vim-golo[Vim]
- https://github.com/k33g/sublime-golo[Sublime Text 2]
- https://github.com/k33g/golo-storm[IntelliJ IDEA (syntax highthing)]
- https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-netbeans[Netbeans] (contributed by http://www.serli.com/[Serli])

=== Hello world ===

Golo source code need to be placed in _modules_. Module names are
separated with dots, as in:

[source,text]
----
Foo
foo.Bar
foo.bar.Baz
(...)
----

It is suggested yet not enforced that the first elements in a module
name are in lowercase, and that the last one have an uppercase first
letter.

A Golo module can be executable if it has a _function_ named `main` and
that takes an argument for the JVM program arguments:

[source,text]
----
module hello.World

function main = |args| {
  println("Hello world!")
}
----

`println` is a predefined function that outputs a value to the standard
console. As you can easily guess, here we output `Hello, world!` and
that is an awesome achievement.

NOTE: Newlines are important in Golo, so make sure that your editor ends files with a newline.

=== Running _"Hello world"_ with `gologolo` ===

Of course, we need to run this incredibly complex application.

Golo comes with a `gologolo` script found in the distribution `bin/`
folder. Provided that it is available from your current `$PATH`, you may
simply invoke it as follows:

[source,console]
----
$ gologolo samples/helloworld.golo
Hello world!
$
----

`gologolo` takes several Golo source files as input. It expects the last
one to have a `main` function to call. The Golo code is compiled on the
fly and executed straight into a JVM.

You may also pass arguments to the `main` function by appending `--args`
on the command line invocation. Suppose that we have a module `EchoArgs`
as follows:

[source,text]
----
module EchoArgs

function main = |args| {
  foreach (arg in args) {
    println("->  " + arg)
  }
}
----

We may invoke it as follows:

[source,console]
----
$ gologolo samples/echo-args.golo --args plop da plop
-> plop
-> da
-> plop
$
----

Note that `args` is expected to be an array.

=== Compiling Golo source code ===

Golo comes with a `goloc` compiler that generates JVM bytecode in
`.class` files. We will give more details in the chapter on
interoperability with Java.

Compiling Golo files is straightforward:

[source,console]
----
$ goloc -output classes samples/helloworld.golo
$
----

This compiles the code found in `samples/helloworld.golo` and outputs
the generated classes to a `classes` folder (it will be created if
needed):

[source,console]
----
$ tree classes/
classes/
└── hello
    └── World.class

1 directory, 1 file
$
----

=== Running compiled Golo code ===

Golo provides a `golo` command for running compiled Golo code:

[source,console]
----
$ cd classes
$ golo hello.World
Hello world!
$
----

Simple, isn't it?

=== Passing JVM-specific flags ===

Both `golo` and `gologolo` can be given JVM-specific flags using the `JAVA_OPTS` environment
variable. 

As an example, the following runs `fibonacci.golo` and prints JIT compilation along the way:

[source,console]
----
# Exporting an environment variable
$ export JAVA_OPTS=-XX:+PrintCompilation
$ gologolo samples/fibonacci.golo

# ...or you may use this one-liner
$ JAVA_OPTS=-XX:+PrintCompilation gologolo samples/fibonacci.golo
----

=== Comments ===

Golo comments start with a `#`, just like in Bash, Python or Ruby:

[source,text]
----
# This is a comment
println("WTF?") # it works here, too
----

=== Variables and constants ===

Golo does not check for types at compile time, and they are not
declared. Everything happens at runtime in Golo.

Variables are declared using the `var` keyword, while constants are
declared with `let`. It is strongly advised that you favour `let` over
`var` unless you are certain that you need mutability.

Variables and constants need to be initialized when declared. Failing to
do so results in a compilation error.

Here are a few examples:

[source,text]
----
# Ok
var i = 3
i = i + 1

# The assignment fails because truth is a constant
let truth = 42
truth = 666

# Invalid statement, variables / constants have to be initialized
var foo
----

Valid names contain upper and lower case letters within the `[a..z]` range, underscores (`_`),
dollar symbols (`$`) and numbers. In any case, an identifier must not start with a number.

[source,text]
----
# Ok, but not necessarily great for humans...
let _$_f_o_$$666 = 666

# Wrong!
let 666_club = 666
----

=== Data literals ===

Golo supports a set of data literals. They directly map to their counterparts from the Java Standard
API. We give them along with examples in <<data-literals,the data literals table>> below.

[options="header",id="data-literals"]
|===
|Java type | Golo literals

|`null` | `null`

|`java.lang.Boolean` | `true` or `false`

|`java.lang.String` | `"hello world"`

|`java.lang.Character` | `'a'`, `'b'`, ...

|`java.lang.Integer` | `123`, `-123`, ...

|`java.lang.Long` | `123_L`, `-123_L`, ...

|`java.lang.Double` | `1.234`, `-1.234`, `1.234e9`, ...

|`java.lang.Float` | `1.234_F`, `-1.234_F`, `1.234e9_F`, ...

|`java.lang.Class` | `String.class`, `java.lang.String.class`, `gololang.Predef.module`, ...

| `java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle` | `^foo`, `^some.module::foo`, ...

|===

=== Operators ===

Golo supports the following <<operators,set of operators>>.

[options="header",id="operators"]
|===
|Symbol(s) |Description |Examples

|`+`|
Addition on numbers and strings.|
`1 + 2` gives 3.

`"foo" + "bar"` gives `"foobar"`.

`"foo" + something` where `something` is any object instance is equivalent to
`"foo" + something.toString()` in Java.

|`-`|
Subtraction on numbers.|
`4 - 1` gives `3`.

|`*`|
Multiplication on numbers and strings.|
`2 * 2` gives `4`.

`"a" * 3` gives `"aaa"`.

|`/`|
Division on numbers.|
`4 / 2` gives `2`.

|'%'|
Modulo on numbers.|
`4 % 2` gives `0`, `3 % 2` gives `1`.

|`"<"`, `"<="`, `"=="`, `"!="`, `">"`, `">="`|
Comparison between numbers and objects that implement `java.lang.Comparable`.
`==` is equivalent to calling `Object#equals(Object)` in Java.|
`1 < 2` gives `true`.

|`is`, `isnt`|
Comparison of reference equality.|
`a is b` gives `true` only if `a` and `b` reference the same object instance.

|`and`, `or`, `not`|
Boolean operators. `not` is of course a unary operator.|
`true and true` gives `true`, `not(true)` gives `false`.

|`oftype`|
Checks the type of an object instance, equivalent to the `instanceof` operator
in Java.|
`("plop" oftype String.class)` gives `true`.

|`orIfNull`|
Evaluates an expression and returns the value of another one if `null`.|
`null orIfNull "a"` gives `"a"`. `foo() orIfNull 0` gives the value of calling `foo()`, or `0` if
`foo()` returns `null`.

=== Calling a method ===

Although we will discuss this in more details later on, you should already know that `:` is used to
invoke instance methods.

You could for instance call the `toString()` method that any Java object has, and print it out as
follows:

[source,text]
----
println(123: toString())
println(someObject: toString())
----

=== Java / JVM arrays ===

As you probably know, arrays on the JVM are special objects. Golo deals with such arrays as being
instances of `Object[]` and does not provide a wrapper class like many languages do. A Java / JVM
array is just what it is supposed to be.

Golo adds some sugar to relieve the pain of working with arrays. Golo allows some special methods to
be invoked on arrays:

- `get(index)` returns the value at `index`,
- `set(index, value)` sets `value` at `index`,
- `length()` returns the array length,
- `iterator()` returns a `java.util.Iterator`,
- `toString()` delegates to `java.util.Arrays.toString(Object[])`,
- `asList()` delegates to `java.util.Arrays.asList(Object[])`,
- `equals(someArray)` delegates to `java.util.Arrays.equals(this, someArray)`.

Given a reference `a` on some array:

[source,text]
----
# Gets the element at index 0
a: get(0)

# Replaces the element at index 1 with "a"
a: set(1, "a")

# Nice print
println(a: toString())

# Convert to a real collection
let list = a: asList()
----

WARNING: The methods above do **not** perform array bound checks.

Finally, arrays can be created with the `Array` function, as in:

----
let a = Array(1, 2, 3, 4)
let b = Array("a", "b")
----
