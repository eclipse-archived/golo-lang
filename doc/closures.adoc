== Closures

Golo supports *closures*, which means that functions can be treated as first-class citizen.

=== Defining and using a closure

Defining a closure is straightforward as it derives from the way a function can be defined:

[source,golo]
----
let adder = |a, b| {
  return a + b
}
----

At runtime, a closure is an instance of `gololang.FunctionReference`, which is essentially a boxing
of `java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle`. This means that you can do all the operations that method
handles support, such as invoking them or inserting arguments as illustrated in the following
example:

[source,golo]
----
let adder = |a, b| {
  return a + b
}
println(adder: invoke(1, 2))

let addToTen = adder: bindTo(10)
println(addToTen: invoke(2))
----

As one would expect, this prints `3` and `12`.

In order to make closure's invocations more _fluent_ you can insert argument using the closure's parameter names.

[source,golo]
----
let mul = |a, b| {
  return a * b
}

let tenTimes = mul: bindAt("a", 10)
# 20
println(tenTimes: invoke(2))
----

=== Compact closures

Golo supports a compact form of closures for the cases where their body consists of a single
expression. The example above can be simplified as:

[source,golo]
----
let adder = |a, b| -> a + b
----

You may also use this compact form when defining regular functions, as in:

[source,golo]
----
module Foo

local function sayHello = |who| -> "Hello " + who + "!"

# Prints "Hello Julien!"
function main = |args| {
  println(sayHello("Julien"))
}
----

=== Calling closures

While you may call function references using `invoke`, there is a (much) better way.

When you have a reference to a closure, you may simply call it as a regular function. The previous
`adder` example can be equivalently rewritten as:

[source,golo]
----
let adder = |a, b| -> a + b
println(adder(1, 2))

let addToTen = adder: bindTo(10)
println(addToTen(2))
----

=== Limitations

Closures have access to the lexical scope of their defining environment. Consider this example:

[source,golo]
----
function plus_3 = {
  let foo = 3
  return |x| -> x + foo
}
----

The `plus_3` function returns a closure that has access to the `foo` reference, just as you would
expect. The `foo` reference is said to have been *captured* and made available in the closure.

It is important to **note that captured references are constants within the closure**. Consider the
following example:

[source,golo]
----
var a = 1
let f = {
  a = 2   # Compilation error!
}
----

The compilation fails because although `a` is declared using `var` in its original scope, it is
actually passed as an argument to the `f` closure. Because function parameters are implicitly
constant references, this results in a compilation error.

That being said, a closure has a reference on the same object as its defining environment, so a
mutable object is a sensible way to pass data back from a closure as a side-effect, as in:

[source,golo]
----
let list = java.util.LinkedList()
let pump_it = {
  list: add("I heard you say")
  list: add("Hey!")
  list: add("Hey!")
}
pump_it()
println(list)
----

which prints `[I heard you say, Hey!, Hey!]`.

=== Closures to single-method interfaces

The Java SE APIs have plenty of interfaces with a single method: `java.util.concurrent.Callable`,
`java.lang.Runnable`, `javax.swing.ActionListener`, etc.

The predefined function `asInterfaceInstance` can be used to convert a method handle or Golo closure
to an instance of a specific interface.

Here is how one could pass an action listener to a `javax.swing.JButton`:

[source,golo]
----
let button = JButton("Click me!")
let handler = |event| -> println("Clicked!")
button: addActionListener(asInterfaceInstance(ActionListener.class, handler))
----

Because the `asInterfaceInstance` call consumes some readability budget, you may refactor it with a
local function as in:

[source,golo]
----
local function listener = |handler| -> asInterfaceInstance(ActionListener.class, handler)

# (...)
let button = JButton("Click me!")
button: addActionListener(listener(|event| -> println("Clicked!")))
----

Here is another example that uses the `java.util.concurrent` APIs to obtain an executor, pass it a
task, fetch the result with a `Future` object then shut it down:

[source,golo]
----
function give_me_hey = {
  let executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
  let future = executor: submit(asInterfaceInstance(Callable.class, -> "hey!"))
  let result = future: get()
  executor: shutdown()
  return result
}
----

=== Closures to Java 8 functional interfaces

Java 8 introduced support for the so-called _lambdas_.
The mechanism works through
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html[functional interfaces],
that is, interfaces with a single abstract method that are annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.

Golo provides a `asFunctionalInterface` pre-defined function to convert closures and that works like
the `asInterfaceInstance` function:

[source,golo]
----
let always_true = asFunctionalInterface(java.lang.function.Predicate.class, |obj| -> true)
----

=== Direct closure passing works

When a function or method parameter of a Java API expects a single method interface type or a
functional interface, you can pass a closure directly, as in:

[source,golo]
----
# Swing action listeners, a classic!
let button = JButton("Click me!")
button: addActionListener(|event| -> println("Clicked!"))

# Java 8 streams / lambdas interop
let result = list[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
  stream():
  map(|n| -> n * 10):
  reduce(0, |acc, next| -> acc + next)
----

Note that this causes the creation of a method handle proxy object for each function or method
invocation. For performance-sensitive contexts, we suggest that you use either
`asInterfaceInstance`, the `to` conversion method described hereafter, or `asFunctionalInterface`.

=== Conversion to single-method interfaces

Instead of using `asInterfaceInstance`, you may use a *class augmentation* which is described later in this
documentation. In short, it allows you to call a `to` method on instances of `MethodHandle`, which
in turn calls `asInterfaceInstance`. Back to the previous examples, the next 2 lines are equivalent:

[source,golo]
----
# Calling asInterfaceInstance
future = executor: submit(asInterfaceInstance(Callable.class, -> "hey!"))

# Using a class augmentation
future = executor: submit((-> "hey!"): to(Callable.class))
----

=== Getting a reference to a closure / Golo function

You may also take advantage of the predefined `fun` function to obtain a reference to a closure, as
in:

[source,golo]
----
import golotest.Closures

local function local_fun = |x| -> x + 1

function call_local_fun = {

  # local_fun, with a parameter
  var f = fun("local_fun", golotest.Closures.module, 1)

  # ...or just like this if there is only 1 local_fun definition
  f = fun("local_fun", golotest.Closures.module)

  return f(1)
}
----

Last but not least, we have an even shorter notation if function are not overridden:

[source,golo]
----
import golotest.Closures

local function local_fun = |x| -> x + 1

function call_local_fun = {

  # In the current module
  var f = ^local_fun

  # ...or with a full module name
  f = ^golotest.Closures::local_fun

  return f(1)
}
----

If the function is overridden, that is several functions exist with the same name but different arities, 
you *must* specify the arity with the notation `^moduleName::functionName\arity`. For instance:

[source,golo]
----
local function foo = |a, b| -> a * b

local function foo = |x| -> x + 1

function call_foo = {
  return ^foo\2(^foo\1(20), 2)
}
----

In this case, one can even specify if a varargs function is needed or not (since arity alone can be ambiguous) using final `...`:

[source,golo]
----
local function foo = |a| -> "unary"
local function foo = |a...| -> "variable"

^foo\1(null) # unary
^foo\1...()  # variable
----

Note that you can in the same way get a reference to a Java static method. For
instance:

[source,golo]
----
list["Foo", null, 42]: filter(^java.util.Objects::nonNull)
----

You can also get a reference to a non-static method. In this case, the function
will accept an instance of the class as first argument, as in:

[source,golo]
----
list["Foo", "Bar", "Hello", "Goodbye"]: map(^String::length)
----

=== Binding and composing

You can bind a function first argument using the `bindTo(value)` method. If you need to bind an
argument at another position than 0, you may take advantage of `bindAt(position, value)`:

[source,golo]
----
let diff = |a, b| -> a - b
let minus10 = diff: bindAt(1, 10)

# 10
println(minus10(20))
----

You may compose functions using the `andThen` method:

[source,golo]
----
let f = (|x| -> x + 1): andThen(|x| -> x - 10): andThen(|x| -> x * 100)

# -500
println(f(4))
----

or:

[source,golo]
----
function foo = |x| -> x + 1
function bar = |x| -> 2 * x

function main = |args| {
  let newFunction = ^foo: andThen(^bar)

  # 8
  println(newFunction(3))
}
----

=== Calling functions that return functions

Given that functions are first-class objects in Golo, you may define functions (or closures) that
return functions, as in:

[source,golo]
----
let f = |x| -> |y| -> |z| -> x + y + z
----

You could use intermediate references to use the `f` function above:

[source,golo]
----
let f1 = f(1)
let f2 = f1(2)
let f3 = f2(3)

# Prints '6'
println(f3())
----

Golo supports a nicer syntax if you don't need intermediate references:

[source,golo]
----
# Prints '6'
println(f(1)(2)(3)())
----
