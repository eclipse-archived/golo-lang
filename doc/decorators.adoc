== Decorators

Golo features Python-like decorators.

=== Presentation
//<<<
Decorators are similar in syntax and purpose to Java annotations.
However, the concepts behind them are very different. Indeed, whereas Java
annotations are compiler or VM directives, decorators are actually plain
functions, more precisely higher order functions.

NOTE: Higher order functions (HOF) are functions that process functions, i.e. that take
a function as parameter, and may return a new function.

A decorator is thus a function that take the function to decorate as parameter,
and return a new function, generally a wrapper that do some stuffs before or
after calling the original function.

The name can remind the well known
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern[GoF Pattern], with good reason.
This pattern describe a design that allow an object to be augmented by wrapping
it in an other object with the same interface, delegating operations to the
wrapped object. This is exactly what a decorator does here, the interface
being "function" (more precisely a `gololang.FunctionReference`).

//>>>

=== Principles and syntax
//<<<
As in Python, and similarly to Java annotations, a decorator is used with a
`@` prefix before the function definition. As an example, the decorator
`deco1` only prints its name before returning the result unchanged

[source,golo]
----
function deco1 = |fun| {
  return |args...| {
    return "deco1 + " + fun: invoke(args)
  }
}
----

It can be used as:

[source,golo]
----
@deco1
function foo = |a| {
  return "foo: " + a
}
----

Here, calling `println(foo(1))` will print `deco1 + foo: 1`.

To be the most generic, the function created by a decorator should be a
variable arity function, and thus call the decorated function with
`invoke`, such that it can be applied to any function, regardless
of its arity, as in the previous example.

Indeed, suppose you what to a decorator `dec` (that does nothing) used like:
[source,golo]
----
@dec
function add = |a,b| -> a + b
----

Such a decorator can be implemented as:
[source,golo]
----
function dec = |func| -> |a, b| -> func(a, b)
----

But in that case, it will be applicable to two parameters functions only.
On the other hand, you cannot do:
[source,golo]
----
function dec = |func| -> |args...| -> func(args)
----

Indeed, this will throw an exception because `func` is not a variable arity
function (just a reference on `add` function) and thus cannot take an array
as parameter. In this case, the decorator have to invoke the original function
like this:
[source,golo]
----
function dec = |func| -> |args...| -> func(args: get(0), args: get(1))
----

which is equivalent to the first form, but is not generic. The more generic
decorator is thus:
[source,golo]
----
function dec = |func| -> |args...| -> func: invoke(args)
----

which can deal with any function.


As illustrated, the decorator is just a wrapper (closure) around the decorated
function. The `@` syntax is just syntactic sugar. Indeed, it can also be used
as such:

[source,golo]
----
function bar = |a| -> "bar: " + a

function main = |args| {
  println(deco1(^bar)(1))

  let decobar = deco1(^bar)
  println(decobar(1))

  println(deco1(|a| -> "bar: "+a)(1))
}
----

prints all `deco1 + bar: 1`.

Decorators can also be stacked. For instance:

[source,golo]
----
function deco2 = |fun| {
  return |args...| {
    return "deco2 + " + fun: invoke(args)
  }
}

@deco2
@deco1
function baz = |a| -> "baz: " + a
----

`println(baz(1))` will print `deco2 + deco1 + baz: 1`

This result can also be achieved by composing decorators, as in:

[source,golo]
----
let deco3 = ^deco1: andThen(^deco2)

@deco3
function spam = |a| -> "spam: " + a
----

Again, `println(spam(1))` will print `deco2 + deco1 + spam: 1`

Moreover, since decorator are just higher order functions, they can be closure
on a first argument, i.e. parametrized decorators, as illustrated in the
following listing:

[source,golo]
----
module tests.LogDeco

function log = |msg| -> |fun| -> |args...| {
  println(msg)
  return fun: invoke(args)
}

@log("calling foo")
function foo = |a| {
  println("foo got a " + a)
}

@log("I'am a bar")
function bar = |a| -> 2*a

function main = |args| {
  foo("bar")
  println(bar(21))
}
----

will print

----
calling foo
foo got a bar
I'am a bar
42
----

Here, `log` create a closure on the message, and return the decorator function.
Thus, `log("hello")` is a function that take a function as parameter, and
return a new function printing the message (`hello`) before delegating to the
inner function.

Again, since all of this are just functions, you can create shortcuts:

[source,golo]
----
let sayHello = log("Hello")

@sayHello
function baz = -> "Goodbye"
----

A call to `println(baz())` will print

----
Hello
Goodbye
----

The only requirement is that the effective decorator (the expression following
the `@`) is eventually a HOF returning a closure on the decorated function. As
an example, it can be as elaborated as:

[source,golo]
----
function log = |msgBefore| -> |msgAfter| -> |func| -> |args...| {
  println(msgBefore)
  let res = func: invoke(args)
  println(msgAfter)
  return res
}

@log("enter foo")("exit foo")
function foo = |a| {
  println("foo: " + a)
}
----

where a call `foo("bar")` will print

----
enter foo
foo: bar
exit foo
----

and with

[source,golo]
----
function logEnterExit = |name| -> log("# enter " + name)("# exit " + name)

@logEnterExit("bar")
function bar = { println("doing something...") }
----

calling `bar()` will print

----
# enter bar
doing something...
# exit bar
----

or even, without decorator syntax:

[source,golo]
----
function main = |args| {
  let strange_use = log("hello")("goodbye")({println(":p")})
  strange_use()

  log("another")("use")(|a|{println(a)})("strange")
}
----

A last thing (but not the least), the function returned by the decorator can
have a different arity than the original one:

[source,golo]
----
function curry = |f| -> |a| -> |b| -> f(a, b)

@curry
function add = |a,b| -> a + b

function main = |args| {
  add(12)(30)
}
----

The `@curry` decorator transform the `add` function that takes two arguments,
into a function that takes only one argument and returns a function that takes
the second argument and finally return the result of the addition.

NOTE: A decorator is applied only if the decorated function is called from Golo
code. For example if you try to call a decorated Golo function from Java code
it will not be the decorated function that will be called but the original one.

TIP: It is possible to create decorator and decorated functions in pure Java:

[source,java]
----
package decorators;

import gololang.annotations.DecoratedBy;
import gololang.FunctionReference;

public class Decorators {

  public static Object decorator(Object original) {
    FunctionReference reference = (FunctionReference) original;
    // do some transformations
    System.out.println("decorator!");
    return reference;
  }

  @DecoratedBy("decorator")
  public static int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }

}
----

Let's call this from Golo:

[source,golo]
----
import decorators.Decorators

function main = |args| {
  println(add(10,32))
}
----

will print:

----
decorator!
42
----


Let's now illustrate with some use cases and examples, with a presentation of
some decorators of the standard module
link:./golodoc/gololang/Decorators[`gololang.Decorators`].
//>>>

=== Use cases and examples
//<<<

Use cases are at least the same as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming[aspect oriented programming]
(AOP) and the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern[Decorator design pattern],
but your imagination is your limit.
Some are presented here for illustration.

==== Logging
//<<<

Logging is a classical example use case of AOP. See the
xref:_principles_and_syntax[Principles and syntax] section for an example.

//>>>

==== Pre/post conditions checking
//<<<
Decorators can be used to check pre-conditions, that is conditions that must
hold for arguments, and post-conditions, that is conditions that must hold for
returned values, of a function.

Indeed, a decorated can execute code before delegating to the decorated
function, of after the delegation.

The module link:./golodoc/gololang/Decorators[`gololang.Decorators`] provide two
decorators and several utility functions to check pre and post conditions.

`checkResult` is a parametrized decorator taking a checker as parameter. It
checks that the result of the decorated function is valid.

`checkArguments` is a variable arity function, taking as much checkers as the
decorated function arguments. It checks that the arguments of the decorated
function are valid according to the corresponding checker (1st argument checked
by 1st checker, and so on).

A checker is a function that raises an exception if its argument is not valid
(e.g. using `require`) or returns it unchanged, allowing checkers to be chained
using the `andThen` method.

As an example, one can check that the arguments and result of a function are
integers with:

[source,golo]
----

let isInteger = |v| {
  require(v oftype Integer.class, v + "is not an Integer")
  return v
}

@checkResult(isInteger)
@checkArguments(isInteger, isInteger)
function add = |a, b| -> a + b
----

or that the argument is a positive integer:

[source, golo]
----

let isPositive = |v| {
  require(v > 0, v + "is not > 0")
  return v
}

@checkArguments(isInteger: andThen(isPositive))
function inv = |v| -> 1.0 / v
----

Of course, again, you can take shortcuts:

[source, golo]
----
let isPositiveInt = isInteger: andThen(isPositive)

@checkResult(isPositiveInt)
@checkArguments(isPositiveInt)
function double = |v| -> 2 * v
----

or even

[source, golo]
----
let myCheck = checkArguments(isInteger: andThen(isPositive))

@myCheck
function inv = |v| -> 1.0 / v

@myCheck
function mul = |v| -> 10 * v
----

Several factory functions are available in
link:./golodoc/gololang/Decorators[`gololang.Decorators`] to ease the creation
of checkers:

* `any` is a void checker that does nothing. It can used when you need to check
  only some arguments of a n-ary function.
* `asChecker` is a factory that takes a boolean function and an error message
  and returns the corresponding checker. For instance:

[source, golo]
----
let isPositive = asChecker(|v| -> v > 0, "is not positive")
----

* `isOfType` is a factory function that returns a function checking types,
   e.g.

[source, golo]
----
let isInteger = isOfType(Integer.class)
----

The full set of standard checkers is documented in the generated *golodoc*
(hint: look for `doc/golodoc` in the Golo distribution).
//>>>

==== Locking
//<<<

As seen, decorator can be used to wrap a function call between checking
operation, but also between a lock/unlock in a concurrent context:

[source,golo]
----
import java.util.concurrent.locks

function withLock = |lock| -> |fun| -> |args...| {
  lock: lock()
  try {
    return fun: invoke(args)
  } finally {
    lock: unlock()
  }
}

let myLock = ReentrantLock()

@withLock(myLock)
function foo = |a, b| {
  return a + b
}
----
//>>>


==== Memoization
//<<<

Memoization is the optimization technique that stores the results of a expensive
computation to return them directly on subsequent calls. It is quite easy,
using decorators, to transform a function into a memoized one. The decorator
creates a closure on a hashmap, and check the existence of the results before
delegating to the decorated function, and storing the result in the hashmap if
needed.

Such a decorator is provided in the
link:./golodoc/gololang/Decorators[`gololang.Decorators`] module, presented
here as an example:

[source, golo]
----
function memoizer = {
  var cache = map[]
  return |fun| {
    return |args...| {
      let key = [fun: hashCode(), Tuple(args)]
      if (not cache: containsKey(key)) {
        cache: add(key, fun: invoke(args))
      }
      return cache: get(key)
    }
  }
}
----

The cache key is the decorated function
and its call arguments, thus the decorator can be used for every module
functions. It must however be put in a module-level state, since in the current
implementation, the decoration is invoked at each call. For instance:

[source, golo]
----
let memo = memoizer()

@memo
function fib = |n| {
  if n <= 1 {
    return n
  } else {
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
  }
}

@memo
function fact = |n| {
  if n == 0 {
    return 1
  } else {
    return n * fact(n - 1)
  }
}
----

//>>>

==== Generic context 
//<<<
Decorators can be used to define a generic wrapper around a function, that
extends the previous example (and can be used to implement most of them).
This functionality is provided by the
link:./golodoc/gololang/Decorators#withContext_context[`gololang.Decorators.withContext`]
standard decorator. This decorator take a context, such as the one returned by
link:./golodoc/gololang/Decorators#defaultContext_[`gololang.Decorators.defaultContext`]
function.

A context is an object with 4 defined methods:

* `entry`, that takes and returns the function arguments.
         This method can be used to check arguments or apply transformation to them;
* `exit`, that takes and returns the result of the function.
          This method can be used to check conditions or transform the result;
* `catcher`, that deal with exceptions that occurs during function execution. It
         takes the exception as parameter;
* `finallizer`, that is called in a `finally` clause after function execution.

The context returned by `gololang.Decorators.defaultContext` is a void one, that
is `entry` and `exit` return their parameters unchanged,
`catcher` rethrow the exception and `finallizer` does nothing.

The workflow of this decorator is as follow:

. the context `entry` method is called on the function arguments;
. the decorated function is called with arguments returned by `entry`;
  .. if an exception is raised, `catcher` is called with it as parameter;
  .. else the result is passed to `exit` and the returned value is returned
. the `finallizer` method is called.

Any of theses methods can modify the context internal state.

Here is an usage example:

[source,golo]
----
module samples.ContextDecorator

import gololang.Decorators

let myContext = defaultContext():
  count(0):
  define("entry", |this, args| {
    this: count(this: count() + 1)
    println("hello:" + this: count())
    return args
  }):
  define("exit", |this, result| {
    require(result >= 3, "wrong value")
    println("goobye")
    return result
  }):
  define("catcher", |this, e| {
    println("Caught " + e)
    throw e
  }):
  define("finallizer", |this| {println("do some cleanup")})


@withContext(myContext)
function foo = |a, b| {
  println("Hard computation")
  return a + b
}

function main = |args| {
  println(foo(1,2))
  println("====")
  println(withContext(myContext)(|a| -> 2*a)(3))
  println("====")
  try {
    println(foo(1, 1))
  } catch (e) { }
}
----

which prints

----
hello:1
Hard computation
goobye
do some cleanup
3
====
hello:2
goobye
do some cleanup
6
====
hello:3
Hard computation
Caught java.lang.AssertionError: wrong value
do some cleanup
----

Since the context is here shared between decorations, the `count` attribute is
incremented by each call to every decorated function, thus the output.

This generic decorator can be used to easily implement condition checking,
logging, locking, and so on. It can be more interesting if you want to provide
several functionalities, instead of stacking more specific decorators, since
stacking, or decorator composition, adds indirection levels and deepen the call
stack.
