== Class augmentations

Many dynamic languages support the ability to extend existing classes by adding new methods to them.
You may think of categories in Objective-C and Groovy, or *open classes* in Ruby.

This is generally implemented by providing *meta-classes*. When some piece of code adds a method
`foo` to, say, `SomeClass`, then all instances of `SomeClass` get that new `foo` method. While very
convenient, such an open system may lead to well-known conflicts between the added methods.

Golo provides a more limited but explicit way to add methods to existing classes in the form of
**class augmentations**.

=== Wrapping a string with a function

Let us motivate the value of *augmentations* by starting with the following example. Suppose that we would
like a function to wrap a string with a left and right string. We could do that in Golo as follows:

[source,golo]
----
function wrap = |left, str, right| -> left + str + right

# (...)
let str = wrap("(", "foo", ")")
println(str) # prints "(abc)"
----

Defining functions for such tasks makes perfect sense, but what if we could just add the `wrap`
method to all instances of `java.lang.String` instead?

=== Augmenting classes

Defining an augmentation is a matter of adding a `augment` block in a module:

[source,golo]
----
module foo

augment java.lang.String {
  function wrap = |this, left, right| -> left + this + right
}

function wrapped = -> "abc": wrap("(", ")")
----

More specifically:

1. a `augment` definition is made on a fully-qualified class name, and
2. an augmentation function takes the receiver object as its first argument, followed by optional
   arguments, and
3. there can be as many augmentation functions as you want, and
4. there can be as many augmentations as you want.

It is a good convention to name the receiver `this`, but you are free to call it differently.

Also, augmentation functions can take variable-arity arguments, as in:

[source,golo]
----
augment java.lang.String {

  function concatWith = |this, args...| {
    var result = this
    foreach(arg in args) {
      result = result + arg
    }
    return result
  }
}

# (...)
function varargs = -> "a": concatWith("b", "c", "d")
----

It should be noted that augmentations work with class hierarchies too. The following example adds an
augmentation to `java.util.Collection`, which also adds it to concrete subclasses such as `java.util.LinkedList`:

[source,golo]
----
augment java.util.Collection {
  function plop = |this| -> "plop!"
}

# (...)
function plop_in_a_list = -> java.util.LinkedList(): plop()
----

=== Augmentation scopes, reusable augmentations

By default, an augmentation is only visible from its defining module.

**Augmentations are clear and explicit as they
only affect the instances from which you have decided to make them visible.**

It is advised to place reusable augmentations in separate module definitions. Then, a module that needs such
augmentations can make them available through imports.

Suppose that you want to define augmentations for dealing with URLs from strings. You could define a
`string-url-augmentations.golo` module source as follows:

[source,golo]
----
module my.StringUrlAugmentations

import java.net

augment java.lang.String {

  function toURL = |this| -> URL(this)

  function httpGet = |this| {
    # Open the URL, get a connection, grab the body as a string, etc
    # (...)
  }

  # (...)
}
----

Then, a module willing to take advantage of those augmentations can simply import their defining module:

[source,golo]
----
module my.App

import my.StringUrlAugmentations

function googPageBody = -> "http://www.google.com/": httpGet()
----

TIP: As a matter of style, we suggest that your module names end with `Augmentations`. Because importing a
module imports **all** of its augmentation definitions, we suggest that you modularize them with *fine
taste* (for what it means).

To allow building libraries of functions leveraging augmentations, the callstack is also looked up in order to find if a complying augmentation was applied to the function arguments. It is thus possible to create a function like:

[source,golo]
----
module MyLib

function sayPlop = |o| {
  println(o: plop())
}
----

that can be applied on any object having a `plop` method, provided this is a native method or it is defined in an augmentation imported in the calling module.


=== Named augmentations

It is possible for augmentations to have a name.
A named augmentation is a set of functions that can be applied to some
classes or structures.

This can be seen as a kind of lightweight
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_%28computer_programming%29[trait],
or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin[mixin],
as found in Rust, Groovy or Scala.

Named augmentations are defined with the `augmentation` keyword.

As an example:
[source,golo]
----
augmentation FooBar = {
  function foo = |this| -> "foo"
  function bar = |this, a| -> this: length() + a
}

augmentation Spamable = {
  function spam = |this| -> "spam"
}
----

A named augmentation is applied using the `augment ... with` construct, as in
[source,golo]
----
augment java.util.Collection with FooBar

augment MyStruct with Spamable

augment java.lang.String with FooBar, Spamable
----

When applying several named augmentations, they are used in the application
order. For instance, if `AugmentA` and `AugmentB` define both the method
`meth`, and we augment `augment java.lang.String with AugmentA, AugmentB`, then
calling `"": meth()` will call `AugmentA::meth`.

Augmentation rules about scopes and reusability apply.
So, if we create a module

[source,golo]
----
module MyAugmentations

augmentation Searchable = {
  function search = |this, value| -> ...
}

augment java.util.Collection with Searchable
----

and import it, we can use the applied augmentation
[source,golo]
----
import MyAugmentations

#...
list[1, 2, 3, 4]: search(2)
----

The augmentations defined in an other module can also be applied, provided they
are fully qualified or the module is imported:
[source,golo]
----
augment java.lang.String with MyAugmentations.Searchable
----

or
[source,golo]
----
import MyAugmentations

augment java.lang.String with Searchable
----

NOTE: If several imported modules define augmentations with the same name, the
*first* imported one will be used.

The validity of the application is not checked at compile time. Thus augmenting
without importing the coresponding module, as in:
[source,golo]
----
augment java.lang.String with Searchable
----

will not raise an error, but trying to call `search` on a `String` will throw a
`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: class java.lang.String::search` at *runtime*.

IMPORTANT: As for every augmentation, no checks are made that the augmentation
can be applied to the augmented class. For instance, augmenting `java.lang.Number`
with the previous `FooBar` augmentation will raise
`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: class java.lang.Integer::length`
at *runtime* when trying to call `1:bar(1)`. Calling `1:foo()` will be OK however.

=== Augmentations Resolution Order

The augmentations resolution order is as follows:

1. native java method (i.e. an augmentation can't override a native java method),
2. locally applied augmentations:
    a. simple augmentations: `augment MyType { ... }`,
    b. named augmentations: `augmentation Foo = { ... }`
       and `augment MyType with Foo` in the current module. Multiple
       applications are searched in the application order,
    c. externally defined named augmentations with fully qualified
       name: `augmentation Foo = { ... }` in module `Augmentations`, and
       `augment MyType with Augmentations.Foo` in the current module,
    d. named augmentation defined in an imported module:
       `augmentation Foo = { ... }` in module `Augmentations`, and
       `augment MyType with Foo` in the current module that `import Augmentations`
       (imported module are searched in the importation order),
3. augmentations applied in imported modules:
   using the same order than locally applied ones, in the importation order.

The first matching method found is used. It is thus possible to “override” an
augmentation with a more higher priority one (in the sens of the previous order). xref:implicit_imports[Implicit modules] are imported after explicit ones to allow to redefine standard augmentations.

TIP: Since importing a module imports all the applied augmentations, and given
the somewhat complex resolution order when involving simple and named
augmentations, being local, external or imported, and involving class
hierarchies, knowing which method will be applied on a given type can be difficult.
A good modularisation and a careful application are recommended.

=== Defining a fallback behavior

Users can augment a class with a `fallback` behavior to give a very last chance to a failed
method dispacth.

[source,golo]
----
augment java.lang.String {
  function fallback = |this, name, args...| {
    return "Dispatch failed for method: " + name + " on instance " + this + ", with args: " + args: asList(): join(" ")
  }
}

println("golo": notExistingMethod(1,2))
# Prints "Dispatch failed for method: notExistingMethod on instance golo, with args: [1, 2]"
----

=== Standard augmentations

Golo comes with a set of pre-defined augmentations over collections, strings, closures and more.

These augmentation do not require a special import, and they are defined in the
link:./golodoc/gololang/StandardAugmentations[`gololang.StandardAugmentations`] module.

Here is an example:

[source,golo]
----
let odd = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: filter(|n| -> (n % 2) == 0)

let m = map[]
println(m: getOrElse("foo", -> "bar"))
----

The full set of standard augmentations is documented in the generated *golodoc* (hint: look for
`doc/golodoc` in the Golo distribution).
