== Misc. modules

Not everything fits into the main documentation. We encourage you to also look at the _javadocs_
and _golodocs_.

The next subsections provide summaries of misc. modules found as part of Golo.

=== Standard augmentations (`gololang.StandardAugmentations`) ===

This Golo module provides standard augmentations for various classes of the Java standard classes
and Golo types. It does not have to be imported explicitely.

Here are a few examples.

Java collections can be have functional methods:

[source,golo]
----
println(list[1, 2, 3, 4]: filter(|n| -> (n % 2) == 0))
println(list[1, 2, 3]: map(|n| -> n * 10))
----

Insert a map entry only if the key is not present, and get a default value if an entry is missing:

[source,golo]
----
map: putIfAbsent(key, -> expensiveOperation())
map: getOrElse(key, "n/a")
----

Repeat an operation many times:

[source,golo]
----
3: times(-> println("Hey!")
3: times(|i| -> println(i))
----

=== JSON support (`gololang.JSON`)

Golo includes the https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/[JSON Simple] library to provide JSON
support.

While `json-simple` only supports encoding from lists and maps, this API brings support for sets,
arrays, Golo tuples, dynamic objects and structs.

Given a simple data structure, we can obtain a JSON representation:

[source,golo]
----
let data = map[
  ["name", "Somebody"],
  ["age", 69],
  ["friends", list[
    "Mr Bean", "John B", "Larry"
  ]]
]
let asText = JSON.stringify(data)
----

Given some JSON as text, we can get back a data structure:

[source,golo]
----
let data = JSON.parse(text)
println(data: get("name"))
----

The `gololang.JSON` module also provides helpers for JSON serialization and deserialization
with both dynamic objects and structs.

=== Scala-like dynamic variable (`gololang.DynamicVariable`)

Golo has a `DynamicVariable` type that mimics the eponymous class from the Scala standard library.

A dynamic variable has inheritable thread-local semantics: updates to its value are confined to the
current thread and its future child threads.

Given the following code:

[source,golo]
----
let dyn = DynamicVariable("Foo")
println(dyn: value())

let t1 = Thread({
  dyn: withValue(666, {
    println(dyn: value())
  })
})

let t2 = Thread({
  dyn: withValue(69, {
    println(dyn: value())
  })
})

t1: start()
t2: start()
t1: join()
t2: join()
println(dyn: value())
----

one gets an output similar to:

----
Foo
69
666
Foo
----

with the `69` and `666` swapping order over runs.

=== Observable references (`gololang.Observable`)

An observable value notifies observers of updates in a thread-safe manner. An observable can also be
constructed from another observable using the `map` and `filter` combinators:

[source,golo]
----
let foo = Observable("Foo")
foo: onChange(|v| -> println("foo = " + v))

let mapped = foo: map(|v| -> v + "!")
mapped: onChange(|v| -> println("mapped = " + v))

foo: set("69")
----

This yields the following output:

----
foo = 69
mapped = 69!
----

=== Asynchronous programming helpers (`gololang.Async`) ===

This module offers asynchronous programming helpers, especially execution context agnostic promises
and futures. The provided APIs are orthogonal to the execution strategy: it is up to you to execute
code from the same thread, from a separate thread, or by pushing new tasks to a service executor.

Here is an example:

[source,golo]
----
module samples.Concurrency

import java.util.concurrent
import gololang.Async

local function fib = |n| {
  if n <= 1 {
    return n
  } else {
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
  }
}

function main = |args| {
  let executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2)
  let results = [30, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]:
    map(|n| -> executor: enqueue(-> fib(n)):
      map(|res| -> [n, res]))
  reduce(results, "", |acc, next| -> acc + next: get(0) + " -> " + next: get(1) + "\n"):
    onSet(|s| -> println("Results:\n" + s)):
    onFail(|e| -> e: printStackTrace())
  executor: shutdown()
  executor: awaitTermination(120_L, TimeUnit.SECONDS())
}
----

This example takes advantages of an executor augmentation and composable promises and futures to
compute Fibonacci numbers.


=== Lazy lists (`gololang.lazylist`) ===

This module defines a lazy list structure, as well as some utilities to work
with it.

A lazy list behaves like an _immutable_ linked list whose elements are evaluated 
only when needed, as can be found in Haskell for example. 

The next element in the list (the tail) is represented by a closure. The generated value
is cached so that the closure representing the next element is evaluated only once.

This is very useful when using higher order function such as `map`. Mapping
a long lazy list with a function and using only the 3 first elements will only
apply the function to these elements, as opposed to regular lists.

Since the tail closure will be called at most once, and we can't
guarantee when, or even if, it will be called, this closure must be
a pure, side-effect free, function.

Lazy lists can also be used to create infinite lists, also known as generators
(or anamorphisms).

Lastly, they allow for elegant recursive implementations of several classical
algorithms.

For instance, one can create a infinite lazy list containing integers as:

[source,golo]
----
function count = |start| -> cons(start, -> count(start + 1_L))
function count = -> count(0_L)
----

To construct a infinite list of all even multiples of 3, one can then use:

[source,golo]
----
let l = count(): map(|x| -> 3 * x): filter(|x| -> (x % 2) == 0)
----

The `cons` function returns a new lazy list whose head is its first argument,
and the tail its second.

A lazy list implement the `Collection`, interface, while remaining lazy. It is
thus possible to use it in imperative style with a `foreach` construct, or
recursively using `head` and `tail`.
On the other hand, functions or methods like `equals`, `size` or `contains` are
not very efficients, since they must evaluate the whole list, and thus negate
the laziness. They are here for completeness and compatibility with the regular
lists interface, but you should avoid such methods.
