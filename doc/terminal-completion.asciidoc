== Terminal completion ==

Golo provides terminal autocompletion support for the following shells:

 - Bash
 
=== Bash autocompletion ===

A bash script can be found in `share/bash-completion/` to provide autocomplete support for the `golo` and `vanilla-golo` CLI scripts. You may either `source` the script, or drop the script into your `bash_completion.d/` folder and restart your terminal.

TIP: Not sure where your `bash_completion.d/` folder is? Try `/etc/bash_completion.d/` on Linux or `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/` for Mac Homebrew users.
