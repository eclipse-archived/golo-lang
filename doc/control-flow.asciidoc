== Control flow ==

Control flow in Golo is imperative and has the usual constructions found in upstream languages.

=== Conditional branching ===

Golo supports the traditional `if` / `else` constructions, as in:

[source,text]
----
if goloIsGreat() {
  println("Golo Golo")
}

if (someCondition) {
  doThis()
} else if someOtherCondition {
  doThat()
} else {
  doThatThing()
}
----

The condition of an `if` statement does not need parenthesis. You may add some to clarify a more
elaborated expression, though.

=== `case` branching ===

Golo offers a versatile `case` construction for conditional branching. It may be used in place of
multiple nested `if` / `else` statements, as in:

[source,text]
----
function what = |obj| {
  case {
    when obj oftype String.class {
      return "String"
    }
    when obj oftype Integer.class {
      return "Integer"
    }
    otherwise {
      return "alien"
    }
  }
}
----

A `case` statement requires at least 1 `when` clause and a mandatory `otherwise` clause. Each clause
is being associated with a block. It is semantically equivalent to the corresponding `if` / `else`
chain:

[source,text]
----
function what = |obj| {
  if obj oftype String.class {
    return "String"
  } else if obj oftype Integer.class {
    return "Integer"
  } else {
    return "alien"
  }
}
----

IMPORTANT: `when` clauses are being evaluated in the declaration order, and only the first satisfied
one is being executed.

=== `match` statements ===

The `match` statement is a convenient shortcut for cases where a `case` statement would be used to
match a value, and give back a result. While it may resemble *pattern matching* operators in some
other languages it is not fully equivalent, as Golo does not support destructuring.

`match` is a great addition to the Golo programmer:

[source,text]
----
let item = "foo@bar.com"

let what_it_could_be = -> match {
  when item: contains("@") then "an email?"
  when item: startsWith("+33") then "a French phone number?"
  when item: startsWith("http://") then "a website URL?"
  otherwise "I have no clue, mate!"
}

# prints "an email?"
println(what_it_could_be(item))
----

The values to be returned are specified after a `then` keyword that follows a boolean expression to
be evaluated.

Like `case` statements, a `match` construct needs at least one `when` clause and one `otherwise`
clause.

=== `while` loops ===

While loops in Golo are straightforward:

[source,text]
----
function times = |n| {
  var times = 0
  while (times < n) { times = times + 1 }
  return times
}
----

The parenthesis in the `while` condition may be omitted like it is the case for `if` statements.

=== `for` loops ===

This is the most versatile loop construction, as it features:

1. a variable declaration and initialization (a Golo variable is always initialized anyway), and
2. a loop progress condition, and
3. a loop progress statement.

The following function shows a `for` loop:

[source,text]
----
function fact = |value, n| {
  var result = 1
  for (var i = 0, i < n, i = i + 1) {
    result = result * value
  }
  return result
}
----

As you can see, it is very much like a `for` loop in Java, except that:

* the `for` loop elements are separated by `','` instead of `';'`, and
* there cannot be multiple variables in the loop, and
* there cannot be multiple loop progress statements.

Again, this choice is dictated by the pursue of simplicity. 

=== `foreach` loops ===

Golo provides a "for each" style of iteration over iterable elements. Any object that is an instance
of `java.lang.Iterable` can be used in `foreach` loops, as in:

[source,text]
----
function concat_to_string = |iterable| {
  var result = ""
  foreach (item in iterable) {
    result = result + item
  }
  return result
}
----

In this example, `item` is a variable within the `foreach` loop scope, and `iterable` is an object
that is expected to be iterable.

NOTE: Although Java arrays (`Object[]`) are not real objects, they can be used with `foreach` loops.
Golo provides a `iterator()` method for them.

=== `break` and `continue` ===

Although not strictly necessary, the `break` and `continue` statements can be useful to simplify
some loops in imperative languages.

Like in Java and many other languages:

* `break` exits the current inner-most loop, and
* `continue` skips to the next iteration of the current inner-most loop.

Consider the following contrived example:

[source,text]
----
module test
 
function main = |args| {
  var i = 0
  while true {
    i = i + 1
    if i < 40 {
      continue
    } else {
      print(i + " ")
    }
    if i == 50 {
      break
    } 
  }
  println("bye")
}
----

It prints the following output:

----
40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 bye
----

Golo does not support `break` statements to labels like Java does. In fact, this is a `goto`
statement in disguise.

=== Why no value from most control flow constructions? ===

Some programming languages return values from selected control flow constructions, with the returned
value being the evaluation of the last statement in a block. This can be handy in some situations
such as the following code snippet in Scala:

[source,scala]
----
println(if (4 % 2 == 0) "even" else "odd")
----

The Golo original author recognizes and appreciates the expressiveness of such construct. However,
he often finds it harder to spot the returned values with such constructs, and he thought that
trading a few keystrokes for *explicitness* was better than shorter construct based in
*implicitness*.

Therefore, most Golo control flow constructions do not return values, and programmers are instead
required to extract a variable or provide an explicit `return` statement.
