== Functions

Functions are first-class citizen in Golo. Here is how to define and
call some.

=== Parameter-less functions

Golo modules can define functions as follows:

[source,golo]
----
module sample

function hello = {
  return "Hello!"
}
----

In turn, you may invoke a function with a familiar notation:

[source,golo]
----
let str = hello()
----

A function needs to return a value using the `return` keyword. Some
languages state that the last statement is the return value, but Golo
does not follow that trend. We believe that `return` is more explicit,
and that a few keystrokes in favour of readability is still a good deal.

Still, you may omit `return` statements if your function does not return
a value:

[source,golo]
----
function printer = {
  println("Hey!")
}
----

If you do so, the function will actually return `null`, hence `result`
in the next statement is `null`:

[source,golo]
----
# result will be null
let result = printer()
----

=== Functions with parameters

Of course functions may take some parameters, as in:

[source,golo]
----
function addition = |a, b| {
  return a + b
}
----

NOTE: Parameters are constant references, hence they cannot be reassigned.

Invoking functions that take parameters is straightforward, too:

[source,golo]
----
let three = addition(1, 2)
let hello_world = addition("hello ", "world!")
----

=== Variable-arity functions

Functions may take a varying number of parameters. To define one, just
add `...` to the last parameter name:

[source,golo]
----
function foo = |a, b, c...| {
  # ...
}
----

Here, `c` catches the variable arguments in an array, just like it would
be the case with Java. You can thus treat `c` as being a Java object of
type `Object[]`.

Calling variable-arity functions does not require wrapping the last
arguments in an array. While invoking the `foo` function above, the
following examples are legit:

[source,golo]
----
# a=1, b=2, c=[]
foo(1, 2)

# a=1, b=2, c=[3]
foo(1, 2, 3)

# a=1, b=2, c=[3,4]
foo(1, 2, 3, 4)
----

Because the parameter that catches the last arguments is an array, you
may call array methods. Given:

[source,golo]
----
function elementAt = |index, args...| {
  return args: get(index)
}
----

then:

[source,golo]
----
# prints "2"
println(elementAt(1, 1, 2, 3))
----

=== Named parameters

When you invoke Golo functions, you can use the name of the parameters explicitly in the call like so:

[source,golo]
----
function post = |title, body, promoted, tags...| {
  let data = map[
    ["title", title],
    ["body", body],
    ["promoted", promoted],
    ["tags", tags: asList()]
  ]
  return gololang.JSON.stringify(data)
}

post(
  tags = array["feature", "syntax"],
  body = "it rocks!"
  title = "Named parameters are alive",
  promoted = true
)
----

NOTE: Once you are using named parameters in your function call, the order doesn't matter anymore.

NOTE: To name varargs argument, you have be box the values into an `array[]` (just has it's done with the `tags` argument in the above snippet)

CAUTION: You must name either or none of the arguments. A compilation error will be raised, if you mix named an unamed arguments in a function invocation.

=== Functions from other modules and imports

Suppose that we have a module `foo.Bar`:

[source,golo]
----
module foo.Bar

function f = {
  return "f()"
}
----

We can invoke `f` from another module by prefixing it with its module
name:

[source,golo]
----
let r = foo.Bar.f()
----

Of course, we may also take advantage of an `import` statement:

[source,golo]
----
module Somewhere.Else

import foo.Bar

function plop = {
  return f()
}
----

NOTE: Imports in Golo do not work as in Java.
Golo is a dynamic language where symbols are being resolved at runtime. Module imports are
**not** checked at compilation time, and their sole purpose is to help in dynamic resolution. Back
to the previous example, `f` cannot be resolved from the current module, and the Golo runtime
subsequently tries to resolve `f` from each `import` statement. Also, note that the order of
`import` statements is important, as the resolution stops at the first module having the `f`
function.

Last but not least, you may prepend the last piece of the module name. The following invocations are
equivalent:

[source,golo]
----
module Somewhere.Else

import foo.Bar

function plop = {
  let result = f()
  let result_bis = Bar.f()
  let result_full = foo.Bar.f()
  return result
}
----

[[implicit_imports]]
Golo modules have a set of implicit imports:

* `gololang.Predefined`,
* `gololang.StandardAugmentations`,
* `gololang`,
* `java.lang`.

These modules are imported *after* the module explicitly imported in the module, so that elements defined in these modules (e.g. predefined functions or xref:_augmentations_resolution_order[augmentations]) can be redefined.

=== Local functions

By default, functions are visible outside of their module. You may
restrict the visibility of a function by using the `local` keyword:

[source,golo]
----
module Foo

local function a = {
  return 666
}

function b = {
  return a()
}
----

Here, `b` is visible while `a` can only be invoked from within the `Foo`
module. Given another module called `Bogus`, the following would fail at
runtime:

[source,golo]
----
module Bogus

function i_will_crash = {
  return Foo.a()
}
----

=== Module-level state

You can declare `let` and `var` references at the module level, as in:

[source,golo]
----
module Sample

let a = 1

var b = truth()

local function truth = {
  return 42
}
----

These references get initialized when the module is being loaded by the Java virtual machine. In
fact, module-level state is implemented using `private static` fields that get initialized in a
`<clinit>` method.

Module-level references are only visible from their module, although a function may provide
accessors to them.

It is important to note that such references get initialized in the order of declaration in the
source file. Having initialization dependencies between such references would be silly anyway, but
one should keep it in mind _just in case_.

CAUTION: Global state is a bad thing in general. We strongly advise you to *think twice* before you
introduce module-level state. Beware of potential memory leaks, just like `static` class fields in
the Java programming language.
