to dynamically link at runtime an invocation instruction to the target code that will be effectively executed.

An invocation is done in three steps:

- first, a computation is executed to find the target code,
- then, the call site of the invocation is plugged to this target,
- finally the target code is executed as if it had been linked at load time.

The first two phases are mostly executed once for a call site, according there's no need to re-link the call site to his target code.

A function call marked with bang (`!`) is directly linked to the result returned by the target execution.

A banged invocation is executed like this:

- first, a computation is executed to find the target code,
- then the target code is executed,
- finally, the call site of the invocation is plugged to a constant MethodHandle
footnote:[ http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandles.html#constant(java.lang.Class,%20java.lang.Object)[Constant MethodHandle] ]
which returns the target computation result as a constant value.

=== Principles and syntax

A function call marked with bang (`!`) will be called only once,
the result is stored as a constant and will be directly returned for every subsequent call.

A function call can be marked with a bang like in the following example:

[source,golo]
----
module sample

function take_a_while  = {
  # ... complex computation
  return 42
}


function main = |args| {

  foreach i in range(0, 100) {
   take_a_while!()
  }

}
----

In this example `take_a_while` is computed only once at the first call, and then this function returns directly the previously computed result as a constant for every subsequent call.

NOTE: The `!` notation can only be used on regular function calls. Indeed, since methods are context
dependant (the object itself), it is not allowed to “bang” them. As a consequence, a function
invocation using `invoke` of a function reference can't use this feature.

Bang function call is a kind of memoization but regardless of the given parameters:

[source,golo]
----
module sample

function hello = |name| {
  return "Hello " + name + "!"
}


function main = |args| {
  foreach name in ["Peter", "John", "James"] {
    println( hello!(name) # will always print 'Hello Peter!'
  }
}
----

In this example `hello` is executed at the first call with the parameter
`"Peter"`, then always returns `"Hello Peter!"`, even when called with other
values.

WARNING: Functions having side effects *should* not be marked, since the computation
is not done for subsequent calls, and thus the side effect can't happen. In the
same way, function that depends on an outside context are risky. Indeed, a
change in the context won't imply a change in the result any more. In other
words, only _pure_ functions should be marked with a `!`. No check is done by
the language, use it at your own risk.

The result of a banged function call is constant within the same call place,
but different for each call instructions.

[source,golo]
----
module sample

function hello = |name| {
  return "Hello " + name + "!"
}

function main = |args| {
  println( hello!("Foo") ) # will print 'Hello Foo!'
  println( hello!("Bar") ) # will print 'Hello Bar!'
  foreach name in ["Peter", "John", "James"] {
   println( hello!(name) # will always print 'Hello Peter!'
  }
  foreach name in ["Peter", "John", "James"] {
   println( hello(name) # will print 'Hello Peter!', 'Hello John!', 'Hello James!'
  }
}
----

In the previous listing, the `hello!(name)` in the loop is considered the same
call, and thus evaluated only on the first iteration. On the other hand, the
previous calls with `"Foo"` and `"Bar"` are distinct, and therefore prints
different results.


Anonymous function call and object constructor call can be banged too:

[source,golo]
----
module sample

function closure = |x| {
  return |y| {
    return x * y
  }
}

function singleton = -> java.lang.Object!()

function main = |args| {

  foreach i in range(0, 100) {
    println( closure(i)!(i) ) # will always print 0
  }

  require(
    singleton(): hashCode() == singleton(): hashCode(),
    "Houston, ..."
  )
}
----

In this example `closure(i)!(i)` always return `0` because:

- `closure(i)` returns a closure (`|y| -> x * y`) with `x` as enclosed variable
- `closure(i)` is computed for each value of `i`
- the closure returned by `closure(i)` is called at the first iteration with `0` for `x` and `y`
- for every subsequent call `closure(i)` is still computed but ignored because the anonymous call is replaced by the return of a constant value

The `singleton` function return a new java Object but the `java.lang.Object` is created with a banged constructor call, then the returned reference is constant.


=== Banged decorators 

As explained in the xref:_decorators[decorators part] the following `identity` function:

[source,golo]
----
function decorator =  |func| -> |x| -> func(x)

@decorator
function identity = |x| -> x
----

is expanded to:

[source,golo]
----
function decorator =  |func| -> |x| -> func(x)

function identity = |x| -> decorator(|x| -> x)(x)
----

A banged decorator declared with the `@!` syntax:

[source,golo]
----
function decorator =  |func| -> |x| -> func(x)

@!decorator
function identity = |x| -> x
----

is expanded to:

[source,golo]
----
function decorator =  |func| -> |x| -> func(x)

function identity = |x| -> decorator!(|x| -> x)(x)
----

As seen previously, the `decorator` function is called only the first time.
For every subsequent call, the function reference returned by the decorator is not re-computed but directly used as a constant.


Parametrized decorators can be banged too:

[source,golo]
----
function decorator =  |arg| -> |func| -> |x| -> func(x)

@!decorator(42)
function identity = |x| -> x
----

is expanded to:

[source,golo]
----
function decorator =  |arg| -> |func| -> |x| -> func(x)

function identity = |x| -> decorator(42)!(|x| -> x)(x)
----


NOTE: Considering the return of a banged call is constant, a common pitfall
is to think that differents calls share the same _"context"_ regardless where the call is located into the code.


As an example, consider two functions decorated with the same parametrized decorator:

[source,golo]
----
@!deco("a")
function foo = |a| -> a

@!deco("b")
function bar = |b| -> b
----

These functions are expanded to

[source,golo]
----
function foo = |a| -> deco("a")!(|a| -> a)(a)

function bar = |b| -> deco("b")!(|b| -> b)(b)
----

`deco("a")!(|a| -> a)` return a function that we can name for the example `func_a`,
and `deco("b")!(|b| -> b)` return another function that we can name `func_b`.

Then, for every subsequent call of `foo` and `bar`, the executed code is
somehow equivalent to:

[source,golo]
----
function foo = |a| -> func_a(a)

function bar = |b| -> func_b(b)
----

`func_a` and `func_b` are now constant but different because they are not from the same _"banged call instruction"_.

Performances can considerably increase with banged decorators, since the
decorator function is no more called for each decorated function call.
On the other hand, the decorator function has to be pure (without side-effects) and his parameters stable.
