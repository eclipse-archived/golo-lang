== Dynamic code evaluation

Golo provides facilities for dynamically evaluating code from strings in the form of the
`gololang.EvaluationEnvironment` class. It provides an API that is useful both when used from Golo
code, or when used from a polyglot JVM application that embeds Golo.

=== Loading a module

The code of a complete module can be evaluated by the `asModule` method:

[source,golo]
----
let env = gololang.EvaluationEnvironment()
let code =
"""
module foo

function a = -> "a!"
function b = -> "b!"
"""
let mod = env: asModule(code)
let a = fun("a", mod)
let b = fun("b", mod)
println(a())
println(b())
----

It is important to note that an `EvaluationEnvironment` instance has a `GoloClassloader`, and that
attempting to evaluate module code with the same `module` declaration will cause an error. Indeed, a
class loader cannot load classes with the same name twice.

=== Anonymous modules

The `anonymousModule` method is similar to `asModule`, except that the code to evaluate is free of
`module` declaration:

[source,golo]
----
let env = gololang.EvaluationEnvironment()
let code =
"""
function a = -> "a!"
function b = -> "b!"
"""
let mod = env: anonymousModule(code)
let a = fun("a", mod)
let b = fun("b", mod)
println(a())
println(b())
----

The modules that get evaluated through `anonymousModule` have unique names, hence this method is
suitable in cases where the same code is to be re-evaluated several times.

=== Functions

The `asFunction` and `def` methods evaluate function code. Here is how `asFunction` can be used:

[source,golo]
----
let env = gololang.EvaluationEnvironment()
let code = "return (a + b) * 2"
let f = env: asFunction(code, "a", "b")
println(f(10, 20))
----

It evaluates straight code as the body of a function. Note that `imports` can be used to specify
`import` statements to be available while evaluation the code:

[source,golo]
----
env:
  imports("java.util.LinkedList", "java.util.HashMap"):
  asFunction("""let l = LinkedList()
let m = HashMap()""")
----

The `def` method is similar, except that it has the parameters definition in the code to evaluate:

[source,golo]
----
let env = gololang.EvaluationEnvironment()
let code = "|a, b| -> (a + b) * 2"
let f = env: def(code)
println(f(10, 20))
----

=== Running code 

The first form of `run` method works as follows:

[source,golo]
----
let env = gololang.EvaluationEnvironment()
let code = """println(">>> run")
foreach i in range(0, 3) {
  println("w00t")
}
return 666"""
println(env: run(code)) # => "w00t"x3 and "666"
----

The second form allows passing parameter values in a map:

[source,golo]
----
let env = gololang.EvaluationEnvironment()
let code = """println(">>> run_map")
println(a)
println(b)
"""
let values = java.util.TreeMap(): add("a", 1): add("b", 2)
env: run(code, values)
----

It is important not to abuse `run`, as each invocation triggers the generation of a one-shot
class. If the same code is to be run several times, we suggest that you take advantage of either
`def` or `asFunction`.
