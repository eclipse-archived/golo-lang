== Exceptions ==

Exception handling in Golo is simple. There is no distinction between *checked* and *unchecked*
exceptions.

=== Raising exceptions ===

Golo provides 2 predefined functions for raising exceptions:

- `raise(message)` throws a `java.lang.RuntimeException` with a message given as a string, and
- `raise(message, cause)` does the same and specifies a cause which must be an instance of
  `java.lang.Throwable`.

Throwing an exception is thus as easy as:

[source,golo]
-----------------------
if somethingIsWrong() {
  raise("Woops!")
}
-----------------------

=== Raising specialized exceptions ===

Of course not every exception shall be an instance of `java.lang.RuntimeException`. When a more
specialized type is required, you may simply instantiate a Java exception and throw it using the
`throw` keyword as in the following example:

[source,golo]
---------------------------------------
module golotest.execution.Exceptions

import java.lang.RuntimeException

function runtimeException = {
  throw RuntimeException("w00t")
}
---------------------------------------

=== Exception handling ===

Exception handling uses the familiar `try / catch`, `try / catch / finally` and `try / finally`
constructions. Their semantics are the same as found in other languages such as Java, especially
regarding the handling of `finally` blocks.

The following snippets show each exception handling form.

[source,golo]
--------------------------------------
# Good old try / catch
try {
  something()
} catch (e) {
  e: printStackTrace()
}

# A try / finally
try {
  doSomething()
} finally {
  cleanup()
}

# Full try / catch / finally construct
try {
  doSomething()
} catch (e) {
  e: printStackTrace()
  case {
    when e oftype IOException.class {
      println("Oh, an I/O exception that I was expecting!")
    }
    when e oftype SecurityException.class {
      println("Damn, I didn't expect a security problem...")
      throw e
    }
    otherwise {
      throw e
    }
  }
} finally {
  cleanup()
}
--------------------------------------

TIP: Because Golo is a weakly typed dynamic language, you need to check for the exception type
with the `oftype` operator. In a statically typed language like Java, you would instead have several
`catch` clauses with the exception reference given a specific type. We suggest that you take
advantage of the `case` branching statement.
